WriteBot is an AI-powered handwriting synthesis web application that converts digital text into realistic handwritten SVG documents. The system uses a trained TensorFlow recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate stroke sequences that mimic natural handwriting, with extensive customization options for page layout, styling, and character rendering.

## System Purpose and Scope
WriteBot serves two primary use cases:
+ Single Document Generation: Users input text through a web interface and receive a customized SVG/PDF with handwritten text, configurable across 30+ parameters including page size, margins, line height, text alignment, and handwriting style variations.
+ Batch Processing: Users upload CSV/XLSX files containing multiple text entries and generation parameters, receiving a ZIP archive with individually generated handwriting samples. This supports workflows like generating handwritten assignments, personalized notes, or dataset creation.

The system is deployed as a multi-user web application with role-based access control, activity logging, and usage statistics tracking.
